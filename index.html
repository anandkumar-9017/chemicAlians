		<h3>Chemical Engineering</h3>
		<p>
		<br>
		<b>Chemical engineers</b> are in great demand because of the large number of industries that depend on the synthesis and processing of chemicals and materials. In addition to traditional careers in the chemical, energy and oil industries, chemical engineers enjoy increasing opportunities in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, electronic device fabrication and environmental engineering. The unique training of the chemical engineer becomes essential in these areas when processes involve the chemical or physical transformation of matter.<br> 
        <b>For example</b>, chemical engineers working in the chemical industry investigate the creation of new polymeric materials with important electrical, optical or mechanical properties. This requires attention not only to the synthesis of the polymer, but also to the flow and forming processes necessary to create a final product. In biotechnology, chemical engineers help design production facilities that use microorganisms and enzymes to synthesize new drugs. Problems in environmental engineering that engage chemical engineers include the development of processes (catalytic converters, effluent treatment facilities) to minimize the release of or deactivate products harmful to the environment.(source: cheme.stanford.edu)<br><br>
        MNNIT offers you a platform to shape yourself and pursue chemical engineering as a practitioner in research, industry, government sector (GATE, ESE). Research laboratories under the chemical engineering department are: Chemical Technology laboratory, Process Dynamics & Control laboratory, FFM laboratory, Chemical Reaction Engineering laboratory etc.

       	The chemical engineering department strives to impart high quality technical education with a fine balance of fundamental knowledge, practical exposure and novel concepts. In chemical department all the students will get education with full conceptual learning, and they will learn to discover and disseminate knowledge through research with the help of supportive campus community. 
        The chemical department offers B. Tech, M. Tech, and Ph. D programs in chemical engineering. 
        There will be many exciting and learning events in Avishkar like mock placement event, pump-it, Q-viz and many more where the entire students will get to learn about how to sit in the interview round, will get to learn about the process that includes in making project and also how to present idea in front of others. In other words, these events will help you to make yourself ready for you future.
        Not only Avishkar but there is also events like Azeotropy – a chemical fest of IIT Bombay, where you will compete with other IITs/NITs students. 
        Talking about placements, MNNIT is on 2nd number in terms of placements. In chemical department, there are 100% placements, but due to some students opt for higher studies, the placements remain 90%. In chemical department maximum CTC is 17.3 LPA and average CTC is 8.72 LPA in 2019 and in 2018 maximum CTC is 17.37 LPA and average CTC is 10.003 LPA. 
        Company which visits usually every year are Reliance petrochemicals (main recruiter), hindalco, pepsico, HMEL, BPCL, HPCL and many more depending upon the vacancies. Moreover, remaining in chemical department you can also make yourself ready for non-core side or for consultancy side. 
        Here you will always get a friendly environment and will always be helped by professors and your seniors. They will always be present for you whenever you required.
